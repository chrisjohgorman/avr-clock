# avr-clock
AVR interface to LCD screen to make a digital clock

This code belongs to Peter Fleury 
http://homepage.hispeed.ch/peterfleury/index.html.  I am using his library 
to build a digital clock with an Atmel atmega162 and a Hitachi 44780 LCD 
screen.  His license states that his code is GPL version 3.  As such I will 
upload a GPLv3 License file to this project.  My thanks to Peter for making
the LCD library

The file test_lcd.c is his and I will be modifying it extensively to make the
clock.  I will probably even rename it to something like clock.c.
